#### Feature Tasks 

Create the following components and structure them according to the following diagram.  
``` 
App
  Landing
  Dashboard
    NoteCreateForm
    NoteList
      Noteitem
```
###### App Component
* The App component should manage the frontend routes and have a navbar

* the `/dashboard` route should display the `Dashboard` component

###### Landing Component
* The Landing component should display a brief description of the notes app

###### Dashboard Component 
* The Dashboard component should manage the entire **application state**
* The state should contain a notes array
* It should have a bound `addNote(note)` method that adds a note to `state.notes`
  * each note that gets added should have the following data
    * `_id`: always should contain the result of `uuid()`
    * `editing`: false by default
    * `completed`: false by default
    * `content`: user provided content
    * `title`: user provided title
* It should have a bound `removeNote(note)` method that removes a note from `state.notes` based on its `id`

###### NoteForm Component

###### NoteItem
* should display the notes content and title
* should display a delete button
  * `onClick` the note should be removed from the application state

#### Test
* Test Dashboard
  * Test the initial state
  * Test for changes to the state
* Test NoteCreateForm
  * Test the initial state
  * Test for changes to the state

#### Documentation  
Add your Travis badge to the top of your README (even if your build is failing) and write a description of the project. 

#### Stretch Goals
* Read [Enzyme testing docs](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/master/docs/api/mount.md) and write more tests for your components.
